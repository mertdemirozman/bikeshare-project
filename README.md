### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Udacity Project

### Description

In this project,Using Python to explore data related to bike share systems for  Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Data provided by udacity is imported and interesting quesstions regarding to data is answered. Users can filter the data by day, month or both. 

### How to Use

This repository contains-

One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- bikeshare.py.
To use the project-

Place the bikeshare.py file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.

### Files Used

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities in .csv format ('chicago.csv'; 'new_york_city.csv'; 'washington.csv'). All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

### Questions Explored

The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

Popular times of travel

What is the most popular month for start time?
What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
Popular stations and trip

What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
What is the most popular trip?
Trip duration

What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
User information

What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender? (only available for NYC and Chicago)
What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?

### Getting Started

This program is structured 2 steps.

In a first moment, the user selects
the filters that are going to be
applied to the database. The user is
able to chose as many filters as it
would like.

After this step, the DataFrame for
the analysis is created based on the
filters chosen by the user.

In a second moment, the user is
able to chose, from a list of options,
the statistics the user would like to
calculate, based on the available
filtered data.

### Libraries Used

The libraries used in the project include: time, pandas, numpy, and datetime.

### Special Thanks

I would like to thank the Udacity team. This project is very helpful to introduction data science and people who will give reviews are very helpful and teachful. They were always replies very short time and the feedbacks are always for the showing the road. I will recommend the Udacity for people who wants to learn programming for data science. Thanks!
